 # Exploratory Data Analysis
______________________________________________________________
Project name: datafun-04-jupyter
___________________________________________________________
## Overview
____________________________________________________________
 In this module I will perform tasks that provide the iniital exploratory data analysis and present the finding in an organized outline within the README.md. 

## Objective
_____________________________________________________
 The objective is to introduce Module 4 core compentencies while increases the repreteiton of previuso core comptencies.


### Deliverables üì¶

## Project outline üìù
   A. Environment setup
   This is the time where I can apply skills and core competencies from previous lesson to set up a project.  It is important to continue to do this in a measured application to build repetition.  

   B. Project start
   The module required setting up a jupyter notebook as the project editor.  I used both the VS code interface and the 'localhost:/8888'

   C. Import the dependencise
   This is skill set developed in previous models. Continuing to remeber to import the dependencies is important, but the most important thing is to remember to install them into the environment so you have access to them.
   
   D. Data distribution- numerical
   Below are the images from the jupyter notebook execution.

   I was able to copy these images from the VS Code jupyter interface.  there are three(3) dots to the right of the output cell that gives you the option of copy output.   I just copied the image over and it worked!
